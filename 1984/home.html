	<p>Oceania is governed by the Party, led by the figurehead Big Brother. It is divided into four subsections; The <a href="newspeak.html">Ministry of Truth</a>, the Ministry of Peace, the Ministry of Love, and the Ministry of Plenty. Both Inner and Outer Party members work within these ministries, and help Oceania become the greater and superior super state. We are currently at war with Eurasia. The people of Oceania follow these three slogans: Ignorance is Strength, War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery. Big Brother watches us through telescreens; the modern screen that cannot be turned off, and is always monitoring us.... Step out of line, and the Thought Police is after you.</p>
