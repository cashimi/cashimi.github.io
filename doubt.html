	His words, like daggers, pierce my soul,
	A relentless assault, taking its toll.
	His demands, a mountain, too high to climb,
	In his world of perfection, there's no time.        

	But still, I play on, fueled by a dream,
	Through the abuse, I see a chance
	to be more than me;
	one of the greats, for the both of us.
