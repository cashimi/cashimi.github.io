		<img src="images/guy.png" width=300px>
		<p>Hello! My name is Caitlyn Vu and I'm majoring in Business Management Information System (MIS) major. Digital Media Arts (DMA) is my minor. I decided to do that since it allows me to have a little fun while still focusing on my future career. My goal is to work within the field of UI/UX, so this seemed like a good addition. I don't have a lot of artistic background, but still enjoy being creative!!</p>
