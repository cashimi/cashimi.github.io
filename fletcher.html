		Fletcher, a figure of admiration and fear,
		A master of his craft, crystal clear.
		His drive, a force of nature, relentless and true,        
		In his quest for greatness, he leads the few.

		He molds musicians like clay in his hand,
		Shaping greatness from talents unplanned.
		His dedication, a flame that never dims,
		In his pursuit of perfection, no room for whims.
